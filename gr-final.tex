\begin{abstract}
{\bfseries To address a problem with expressing the ordering
	of vague concepts in traditional fuzzy logic, a kind
	of algebraic structure called hedge algebra was
	proposed as an alternative domain for fuzzy truth
	value and linguistic vague concepts. The progress in
	automated reasoning on fuzzy logic based on hedge
	algebra has been growing substantial, but most of
	them still lack an actual implementation. In this
	report, we propose the design of a system implementing 
	the alpha resolution reasoning method
	on a propositional fuzzy logic based on linear
	symmetrical hedge algebra.
